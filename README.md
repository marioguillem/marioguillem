- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marioguillem

With everything happening today
You dont know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror dont blow it
Look at me when Im talkin to you
You looking at me but I'm lookin through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I dont see nobody else
I see myself I'm looking at the
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
